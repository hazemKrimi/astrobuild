# Introduction
This was my final year of studies projects where my collegue and I worked on a prototype for a project building solution for the agency we had an internship in called [Astrolab](https://astrolab-agency.com).
As there were lockdowns in Tunisia in 2020/2021 because of covid software agencies and clients could not have in person meetings to discuss a client's software project.
So the idea of Astrobuild is to reduce meetings and make the client participate with other stakeholders in the process of creating a software project by tracking and communicating with their associated product owner.
