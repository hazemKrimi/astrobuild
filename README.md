# Introduction
This was my final year of studies projects where my collegue and I worked on a prototype for a project building solution for the agency we had an internship in called [Astrolab](https://astrolab-agency.com).
As there were lockdowns in Tunisia in 2020/2021 because of covid software agencies and clients could not have in person meetings to discuss a client's software project.
So the idea of Astrobuild is to reduce meetings and make the client participate with other stakeholders in the process of creating a software project by tracking and communicating with their associated product owner.

# Features
1. Client
  - Account management
  - Project creation from choosing the templates, features and deliverables (Specification, design, MVP or full build)
  - Project tracking
  - Chat with associated product owner for tracking and support
  - Payment (WIP)
2. Product Owner
  - Account management
  - Management of templates
  - Review of projects and transferring deliverables
  - Chat with clients on their projects
3. Developer
  - Account management
  - Features, categories and wireframes management
4. Admin
  - Identity and access management (WIP)

# Technologies Used
The frontend project is a [React](https://react.dev) application with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) which consumes a set of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) APIs using [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com) and a some REST APIs.
A small components library with a custom theme was made for this project using [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com) which can be viewed at the `components` folder.
The prototyping feature was done using [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev) which is a library for creating and interacting with diagrams.
